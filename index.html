      <p>
        My goal with Quendor is creating a working emulator of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine">Z-Machine</a> and an interpreter for <a href="http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Z-code">zcode</a> programs that will run on that machine. This means I will be building an <a href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Interpreter">interactive fiction interpreter</a>. Depending on your age and/or nostalgia factor, you might better know "interactive fiction" by the name "text adventure."
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Fun fact for nostalgia retrogamers: the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">"interactive fiction"</a> was likely first used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lafore">Robert Lafore</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Z-Machine was originally created by a company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom">Infocom</a> back in the late 1970s to play their adventure game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork"><em>Zork</em></a> on microcomputers (which were the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">"personal computers"</a> with a side evolution into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer">"home computers"</a>). Eventually, this Z-Machine was used to play many text adventure games created by the same company throughout the 1980s.

      <p>
        Starting in the 1990s, after Infocom was acquired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a> and effectively dissolved, hobbyists reverse-engineered the Z-Machine and games have been created for it ever since.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        These "games" are often referred to as "stories," keeping with the focus on interactive <em>fiction</em>.
